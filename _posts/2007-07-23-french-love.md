**Bon Jovi - All About Loving You **  
  
Looking at the pages of my life   
Faded memories of me and you   
Mistakes you know I've made a few   
I took some shots and fell from time to time   
Baby, you were there to pull me through   
We've been around the block a time or two   
I'm gonna lay it on the line   
Ask me how we've come this far   
The answer's written in my eyes   
Every time I look at you   
Baby, I see something new   
That takes me higher than before   
And makes me want you more   
I don't wanna sleep tonight   
Dreamin's just a waste of time   
When I look at what my life's been comin' to   
I'm all about lovin' you   
I've lived, I've loved, I've lost   
I've paid some dues, baby   
We've been to hell and back again   
Through it all you're always my best friend   
For all the words I didn't say   
And all the things I didn't do   
Tonight I'm gonna find a way   
Every time I look at you   
Baby, I see something new   
That takes me higher than before   
And makes me want you more   
I don't wanna sleep tonight   
Dreamin's just a waste of time   
When I look at what my life's been comin' to   
I'm all about lovin' you   
You can take this world away   
You're everything I am   
Just read the lines upon my face   
I'm all about lovin' you
